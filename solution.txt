
First Method: Graphical Analysis in IDA
Load the Executable into IDA

Drag the .exe file into the IDA window and wait for the disassembly process to complete.

Identify the Program Logic

Once the file is disassembled, check the small text box at the beginning of the graph view. Look for connections between blocks, indicated by red lines.

For example, you might see a conditional jump instruction like:

assembly
jz      short loc_1400013C3  ; Jump if Equal or Zero
This indicates a decision point in the program.

Analyze the Conditional Logic

Follow the connections to identify an IF-ELSE structure.

In the IF block, you might find a line like:

assembly
lea     rdx, aFlagN1c3J0bSt8 ; "Flag{n1c3-j0b-st8d3nt}"  
This suggests that the program prints a success message if the condition is met.

In the ELSE block, you might see:

assembly
lea     rdx, aUCanDoBetterNe ; "u can do better next time"  
This indicates a failure message.

Determine the Correct Password

Based on the analysis, the correct password is ->

Flag{n1c3-j0b-st8d3nt}
Second Method: Pseudocode Analysis in IDA
Load the Executable into IDA

Drag the .exe file into the IDA window and wait for the disassembly process to complete.

Generate Pseudocode

Navigate to the main function and press F5 to generate the pseudocode. This provides a higher-level, more readable representation of the program's logic.

Rename Variables and Functions (Optional)

You can rename variables and functions for better clarity by right-clicking on them and selecting Rename.

Analyze the Pseudocode

Look for conditional statements. For example ->

if (_Str._Mypair._Myval2._Mysize == 22 && !memcmp_0(p_Str, "Flag{n1c3-j0b-st8d3nt}", 0x16uLL)) {
    system("timeout /3");
    system("cls");
    std::operator<<<std::char_traits<char>>(std::cout, "I'm glad you've gained more experience");
    system("timeout /t 1");
} else {
    std::operator<<<std::char_traits<char>>(std::cout, "u can do better next time");
}
This code checks if the input string matches "Flag{n1c3-j0b-st8d3nt}" and has a length of 22 characters. If the condition is met, it displays a success message; otherwise, it displays a failure message.

Determine the Correct Password

Based on the pseudocode, the correct password is ->
Flag{n1c3-j0b-st8d3nt}
